# Reddit-Cli

Clone the repo and to run CLI follow the steps below:
Install : npm install
          npm install -g 
          
After Installation:
Just like node cmd if we type reddit in the cmd promt , this cli will take you to reddit and open the random post.

If you will type "reddit --print" then it will print the TITLE of that random post along with the active link to open it.
